## What is Agile Methodologies:

* INDIVIDUAL AND INTERACTIONS:

     * If you have a team and you are working on a project but at the same time you are not interacting with each other so that product will not be successful.
     
     * Because collaboration, communication, creativity, critical thining are the main keys toward effective and successful development.
     
     * Collaboration with like minded individual is very important who are having the same goal because everyone will share their views, all the team members will be
      using their critical thinking and creativity to achieve a success and complete the project effectively.
      
* WORKING SOFTTWARE:
     
     * Prior to Agile, people used to present fully developed product in front of the customers. Rather than using the iterative approach in product/software development
     they would simply just present the product in the market.
     
     * Now after Agile, They first develop a Minimum Viable Product(MVP) and present that in the market. This will be just a software/product that will works but after
     then the team used to integrate the direct feedback of customer for future development in the product.

* CUSTOMER COLLABORATION:
     
     * The collaboration of customer is very impportant. If the team wants to make their software/product successful they should start giving importance to the customer
      participation.
     
     * They should focus on customer needs and wants. That team product will be successful int he market who collaborate and integrate customers needs and wants.
     
     * Collaboration and communication with customers should be their first priority.

* RESPONDING TO CHANGE: 
     
     * The team mind should be ready to accept any change. A sudden change shouldn't effect their work.
          
          * For Example: sudden decrease in the demand of the customer, sudden decrease in the price of the competitor etc.
     
     * It is the responsibility of the team to always come up with alternative ideas to decrease the effect of that change. 
     
     * The team will be successful if they have an adaptive personality.

## ALL TEAMS SHOULD FOLLOW THESE THINGS WHO ARE USING AGILE METHODOLOGY:

* Culture of wrking together with honesty, integrity and passion. THey are tthe foundation of agility.

* Be extremely visible and obvious about any querie to solve it with effective communication and collaboration. 

* Explore different ways to establish, initiate, a new product/software.

* Pay attention to your advancement in mastery, expertiness, and skills.

* MVP(Minimum Viable PRoduct) leads to MVP(Maximm Viable Product) after a certain period.
