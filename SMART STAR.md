     * By team work we'll build a proper track.
     
     * For Example We have a U.S client, so for that we need 25 years plus experienced programmer. To search for a programmer, one person will be searching on Linkedln
     one will be working in the management area, one will be doing research like all team members will be working to build a proper track toward their reach.
